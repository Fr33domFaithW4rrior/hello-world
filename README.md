# hello-world
<h1 align="center">First repository: a little bit of story</h1>
<p>I have always been passionate about the world of computers and programming and, in particular, i always loved the cybersecurity world.</p>
<p>Since i was a little young boy, i spent every single day behind the screen of the computer, learning something new every day. At the age of 8, i managed to discover the password of a computer, because my parents locked that computer, setting a password (they wanted me to make friends and go out).</p>
<p>That was the moment i started to look at things in a different way and, since then, the curiosity about the cybersecurity world has grown more and more.<p>
  
## What programming languages i already know
<p>I know JavaScript</p>

## What programming languages i am still learning
<p>I'm learning Python and Shell Scripting</p>

## Something about my cybersecurity knowledge
<p>To train, i usually use the Kali Linux distribution (i know tools like nmap, wireshark, burp suite, metasploit and others) and i love social engineering topic.</p>

### Other things about me
* I'm totally in favor of Open Source software
* I love to help the others and always try to do that
* I think that everyone should share knowledge with the others
